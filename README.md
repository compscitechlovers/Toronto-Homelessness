# Toronto-Homelessness

## Overview of Paper

There are many people facing homelessness within Toronto, and Youth are one of the most important population category that is currently facing significant amount of homelessness. Youth homelessness is an important issue because it not only impacts the immediate well-being of these individuals but also has long-term consequences for their futures. Moreover, their unique challenges and vulnerabilities call for tailored support and resources to break the cycle of homelessness. By end of my paper, the purpose can easily be imagined as it is to effectively address youth homelessness in Canada by providing targeted support and resources that empower them to build brighter, more stable futures.
